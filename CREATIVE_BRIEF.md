## 1. Hero Concept

**The Bridge Between Broadcast Heritage and AI-Powered Future**

A single scrolling journey that visually demonstrates the transformation from traditional motion graphics mastery (16 years of broadcast precision) into the fluid, intelligent world of AI-enhanced video production. The hero doesn't just tell visitors who Deimantas is—it shows them the evolution they're witnessing, inviting them to step into the future of video content.

## 3. Visual Direction

### Color Palette

**Primary (Light Brutalist Base):**
- `#F5F5F0` — Warm off-white (main background)
- `#000000` — Pure black (borders, primary text)
- `#1A1A1A` — Charcoal (secondary text, subtle depth)

**Accent Colors (Strategic Use):**
- `#FF3B30` — Signal Red (broadcast emergency/critical CTA)
- `#007AFF` — System Blue (interactive states, links)
- `#34C759` — Success Green (completion states, positive feedback)
- Gold gradient (`#FFB800` → `#FFD60A`) — Premium/highlight moments

**Neutral Support:**
- `#E5E5E0` — Light gray (hover states, secondary fills)
- `#404040` — Medium gray (tertiary text)

### Typography

**Hierarchy Strategy:**
1. **Hero Display** — Bold, condensed sans-serif, 12-16vw on full viewport
   - Suggestion: Inter Display or similar grotesque
   - All-caps for maximum impact
   - Tight tracking (-0.02em) for broadcast feel

2. **Section Headings** — Bold sans-serif, 4-6vw
   - Same family as Hero, normal weight
   - Slightly increased tracking for readability

3. **Pillars/Labels** — Monospace, 1.5-2vw
   - IBM Plex Mono or similar
   - References broadcast lower thirds/data display
   - All-caps, wider tracking

4. **Microcopy** — Sans-serif, 14-16px body
   - Inter or system-ui
   - Generous line-height (1.6)

### Motion Style

**Philosophy:** Precision meets fluidity—like a master broadcast switcher learning to dream

**Baseline Behaviors:**
- Scroll-triggered reveals (no autoplay distractions)
- 60fps minimum for all animations
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for entrances (precision snap to rest)
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for transitions (broadcast smoothness)

**Signature Motions:**
1. **The Broadcast Snap** — Hard-edged cut-like transitions for heritage moments
2. **The Flow Morph** — Organic, spring-physics transitions for AI moments
3. **The Grid Breathe** — Subtle scale/shift on the brutalist frame during scroll
4. **The Type Cascade** — Staggered letter/word reveals using the 16-year history

## 4. Directions for Storyteller

### Core Narrative Threads

**Thread 1: Heritage as Foundation**
- Establish credibility immediately
- Use broadcast terminology: "16 YEARS," "TV-READY," "BROADCAST QUALITY"
- Emphasize precision, reliability, deadlines met

**Thread 2: Transformation as Opportunity**
- Frame AI as evolution, not replacement
- Key phrases: "NOW POWERED BY," "NEXT-GENERATION," "FUTURE-READY"
- Show excitement about possibilities, not fear of change

**Thread 3: Invitation as Partnership**
- "WELCOME TO CREOMOTION" — inclusive, warm
- "EXPLORE THE WORKFLOW" — collaborative, transparent
- Three pillars show versatility without dilution

### Copy Requirements by Moment

| Moment | Headline | Subhead/Microcopy |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "16 YEARS OF BROADCAST MOTION GRAPHICS" | "TV-Ready. Brand-Safe. Deadline-Driven." |
| 2 | "NOW POWERED BY AI" | "Traditional craft meets intelligent workflows" |
| 3 | "WHERE PRECISION MEETS INTELLIGENCE" | "Faster iterations. Smarter variations. Same broadcast quality." |
| 4 | "WELCOME TO CREOMOTION" | "TV STATIONS • AGENCIES • STARTUPS" + CTA button |
| 5 | (Transition, minimal) | "Let's create something that moves people." |

### Tone Guidelines

- **Confident** — not arrogant, assured
- **Forward-looking** — optimistic about technology
- **Professional** — appropriate for TV executives and startup founders alike
- **Human** — clear that AI enhances, doesn't replace, the creative

## 5. Directions for Visual Designer

### Composition Rules

**The Frame:**
- Persistent black borders (1-2px) on all sides, but they can "breathe"
- Inner margin: 40px desktop, 20px tablet, 12px mobile
- Borders serve as both container and element—the hero lives *inside* the frame

**The Grid:**
- 12-column with 24px gutter (desktop)
- Headlines can bleed edge-to-edge, body stays within margins
- Asymmetric balance: place visual weight intentionally off-center

**Visual Elements to Create:**

1. **Broadcast Lower Third Component**
   - Animated, modular lower-third graphic
   - Shows "LIVE" indicator, project info
   - Morphs into AI prompt interface in Moment 2

2. **Timeline Visualization**
   - Abstract representation of traditional motion graphics timeline
   - Gradually transforms into "prompt chain" visualization
   - Color: black lines, signal red playhead

3. **Service Pillars (3 icons/badges)**
   - TV STATIONS: Broadcast signal tower or satellite icon
   - AGENCIES: Collaborative nodes or workflow diagram
   - STARTUPS: Rocket or growth arrow (subtle, not cliché)
   - Style: Line icons, 2px stroke, monochrome with hover accent

4. **Neural/AI Abstract**
   - Subtle background texture for Moment 2-3
   - Organic node connections, flowing curves
   - Low opacity (5-10%), creates depth without distraction

### Responsive Considerations

**Desktop (1440p+):**
- Full 5-moment scroll experience
- Decorative elements active
- Typography at maximum scale

**Tablet (768-1024px):**
- 4-moment condensed version
- Combine Moments 2-3
- Typography scales down but maintains hierarchy

**Mobile (< 768px):**
- 3-moment essential version
- Moments 1 → 3 → 4
- Larger tap targets, simplified animations

### Asset Checklist

- [ ] Lower third component (SVG + CSS animation)
- [ ] Timeline/prompt chain SVG
- [ ] Service pillar icons (3 SVGs)
- [ ] Neural network background pattern
- [ ] Scroll indicator animation
- [ ] CTA button states (default, hover, active)
- [ ] Border "breathing" animation (CSS keyframes)

## 6. Directions for DOP (Director of Photography / Visual Flow Architect)

### Viewport as Stage

Treat the hero as a single continuous scene with 5 distinct "shots." The camera is the user's scroll position—scroll speed and direction should feel like camera movement.

### Shot List

**Shot 1: "The Establishing Shot"**
- Composition: Center-weighted, symmetrical
- Movement: Slow zoom-in on headline as user enters
- Depth: Foreground (borders), mid (headline), background (subtle texture)
- Length: First 100vh

**Shot 2: "The Glitch Transition"**
- Composition: Breaking symmetry, elements begin to drift
- Movement: Quick cut-feel transition (30vh), then elements settle new position
- Depth: Foreground gets busy (more elements appear), background stays clean
- Key moment: The "pivot" happens quickly (fast scroll zone recommended)

**Shot 3: "The Two Worlds Collide"**
- Composition: Split-frame or layered elements
- Movement: Left-side elements move differently than right-side
- Depth: Increased—elements overlap with parallax intensity of 0.3-0.5
- Visual metaphor: Two timelines occupying same space

**Shot 4: "The Reveal"**
- Composition: Opening up, more negative space
- Movement: Borders expand outward slightly (CSS transform: scale)
- Depth: Flattened—everything on same plane for clarity
- Focus: All attention on the invitation text

**Shot 5: "The Walk-Off"**
- Composition: Leading lines draw eye to content below
- Movement: Elements fade/dissolve upward as user continues
- Depth: Infinite—draws user into the next section
- Final frame: Horizontal "entry line" across viewport center

### Motion Choreography

| Element | Moment 1 | Moment 2 | Moment 3 | Moment 4 | Moment 5 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Hero Text | Fade up + scale 0.8→1 | Glitch replace | Morph to new text | Max scale, center | Fade out up |
| Borders | Static | Subtle jitter | "Breathing" begins | Expand 20% | Contract back |
| Lower Third | Slide in from bottom | Morph to prompt UI | Split/transform | Exit left | — |
| Accent Color | None | 10% opacity | 30% opacity | 100% (pillars) | Fade |
| Particles | None | None | Sparse emergence | Peak activity | Dissipate |

### Scroll Behavior

- **Snap Points:** Consider subtle snap at moment transitions (optional)
- **Momentum:** Smooth scroll with 0.05-0.1 momentum for premium feel
- **Progress Indicators:** Optional scroll bar that shows which moment you're in
- **Reverse Scroll:** Animations should work backward (user might scroll up)

### Performance Budget

- Target: 60fps on mid-range devices
- Max simultaneous animations: 5-6 elements
- Prefer CSS transforms over JS-driven movement
- Lazy-load heavy assets after Moment 1 in view
- Maximum LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) target: 2.5s

## Summary: The Creative North Star

> *A confident, forward-looking invitation that honors 16 years of broadcast mastery while embracing the exciting possibilities of AI-enhanced creativity. The hero should make TV executives nod in recognition, agency creatives lean forward in curiosity, and startup founders feel the energy of what's possible.*

**Must-Have:**
- Immediate credibility (broadcast heritage)
- Clear AI transformation narrative
- Warm, professional invitation

**Must-Avoid:**
- Trendy AI clichés (robots, overly techy aesthetics)
- Dismissal of traditional motion graphics
- Cold, corporate tone

**Success Metric:**
Visitor reacts with "Wow, this tells a story" without reading a single paragraph of body text.
