- Full three-phase animation
- Split columns in Phase 2
- Large typography scale

### Tablet (768-1024px)
- Condensed Phase 2 (stacked)
- Slightly reduced type sizes
- Same animation sequence

### Mobile (<768px)
- Simplified Phase 2 (single column)
- Reduced type scale (max 48px)
- Shorter animation durations
- Touch-optimized CTA sizing
